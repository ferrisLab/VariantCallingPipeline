Scripts in /original_scripts were created by Natalie Gonzales. We have changed various things across the year to optimize for our respective projects. 

The current, Ferris Legacy, workflow is as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD

    A[Step1] --> B[Step2] --> C[Step3] --> D[Step4] 
    

```


The Alternative workflow is as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD

    A[Step1] --> B[Step2] --> T

        subgraph Diagnostic
        T(Step 2_1) --> X(Step 2_2) --> Y(Step 2_3)

    end
 B .-> C
    Y --> C
    C[Step3] --> D[Step4] --> E[Step5]

    
```
